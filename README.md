This project is a medication reminder system designed for Mylod L, a medication containing two components: Losartan and Amlodipine. Using Streamlit, the app allows users to input details such as the medicine name, dosage, and frequency. It calculates how the concentration of Losartan and Amlodipine changes over time based on their decay rates. When the concentrations fall within a specific target range, the system plays a recorded voicemail to remind the user to take their medication.
